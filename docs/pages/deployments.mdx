# Deployments

Deployments are the smallest execution units in Prezel.

## Visibility

Deployments can be public or private. If a deployment is private, you will need to authenticate in order to access. There are two alternatives here.

If you are using [prezel.app](prezel.app), this will be automatically handled for you.
As long as you are logged in in the console, you will be able to access your private deployments.
If you are not, you will be redirected to the console to log in.

If you are not using the console, you will need to make sure to store a cookie where:
- The key is the the hostname of your server
- The value is the API key assigned to your server

By default, all deployments coming from the default branch of a repository (normally `main`), are public,
and all deployments produced by pull requests are private.

## Lifecycle

## Preview deployments

Preview deployments are created every time a PR is raised in your setup repository
!! what happens with dockerhub and the templates?
They are private by default


## Production deployments

## Configuring deployments with `prezel.json`

A `prezel.json` file placed in the root of your repository allows you to overwrite the default behavior for the deployment.

### Visibility

**Type**: `string`

**Default value**: `"standard"`

This field can be used to change the visibility of the deployment

```json filename="prezel.json" copy
{
  "visibility": "standard"
}
```
